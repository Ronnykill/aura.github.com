<h1>Aura Packages</h1>

<p>The Aura project centers around a collection of independent packages. Each
package is self-contained and has only the things it needs for its core
purpose. None of the packages depends on any of the other; you can use each of
the packages on its own.</p>

<h2>High-Quality, Well-Tested, Standards-Compliant</h2>

<p>With very few exceptions, all classes in all packages have 100% test coverage.</p>

<p>The packages available through the Aura project all conform to the
currently accepted standards of the [PHP Framework Interoperability
Group](http://www.php-fig.org/):
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">PSR-1</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2</a>.
</p>


<h2>Techniques</h2>

<ul>
    
    <li>No use of public properties, unless they are magic via
    `__get()/__set()`</li>

    <li>No use of underscore with protected elements</li>

    <li>Use of the pre-existing Solar <a
    href="http://solarphp.com/manual/appendix-standards.naming.methods">vocabulary
    for methods</a></li>

    <li>Use <a href="https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Di">dependency
    injection</a> proper instead of service locator; the basis for this exists
    at</li>

    <li>Compose functionality as much as possible through dependency
    injection, instead of through inheritance and base classes</li>

    <li>Find effective and reasonable uses for closures/anonymous functions,
    primarily for object creation within the dependency injector service
    definitions</li>

    <li>Use explicit configuration more often than implicit convention</li>

    <li>Use factories as object creators in general, rather than as adapter
    creators in specific</li>

    <li>Windows Vista/7 support as-we-go, so that Windows users are part of
    the community from the very beginning</li>

</ul>
